 Annual-Nominal-Fish-Catches-Casestudy

Overview

The goal of this project was to identify if there was an increase or decrease of fishing in the Northeast Atlantic Region

Data Understanding

The Annual Nominal Fish Catches 2006 - 2014 came from Kaggle, which was officially submitted by 20 member countries of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). It consisted of names of the countries, years with the number of catches, and country code critical information to gain an understanding as to whether or not there was an increase in fish catches.

The chart below shows the names of countries and percentage of catch between 2006 and 2014.

This information was beneficial in displaying a slight increase for a few countries and a decrease for the majority of countries' fish catches.
